Scorer for the game of bowling.
The game will accept as input a list of rolls with the corresponding number of pins knocked down each roll.
As output, the program provides the final score, the running score for each frame,
and a record of whether the bowler had a strike, spare, or open frame for each frame.
Additionally, this implementation should allow for the addition of custom rules.
Submissions should include an example of a custom rule as well as sample inputs/outputs.
